	OBJECTIVE: The paper describes the use of expert's knowledge in practice and the efficiency of a recently developed technique called argument-based machine learning (ABML) in the knowledge elicitation process. We are developing a neurological decision support system to help the neurologists differentiate between three types of tremors: Parkinsonian, essential, and mixed tremor (comorbidity). The system is intended to act as a second opinion for the neurologists, and most importantly to help them reduce the number of patients in the "gray area" that require a very costly further examination (DaTSCAN). We strive to elicit comprehensible and medically meaningful knowledge in such a way that it does not come at the cost of diagnostic accuracy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To alleviate the difficult problem of knowledge elicitation from data and domain experts, we used ABML. ABML guides the expert to explain critical special cases which cannot be handled automatically by machine learning. This very efficiently reduces the expert's workload, and combines expert's knowledge with learning data. 122 patients were enrolled into the study. RESULTS: The classification accuracy of the final model was 91%. Equally important, the initial and the final models were also evaluated for their comprehensibility by the neurologists. All 13 rules of the final model were deemed as appropriate to be able to support its decisions with good explanations. CONCLUSION: The paper demonstrates ABML's advantage in combining machine learning and expert knowledge. The accuracy of the system is very high with respect to the current state-of-the-art in clinical practice, and the system's knowledge base is assessed to be very consistent from a medical point of view. This opens up the possibility to use the system also as a teaching tool.

Patel, V. L., et al. (2009). "The coming of age of artificial intelligence in medicine." Artif Intell Med 46(1): 5-17.
	This paper is based on a panel discussion held at the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Europe (AIME) conference in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in July 2007. It had been more than 15 years since Edward Shortliffe gave a talk at AIME in which he characterized artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine as being in its "adolescence" (Shortliffe EH. The adolescence of AI in medicine: will the field come of age in the '90s? Artificial Intelligence in Medicine 1993;5:93-106). In this article, the discussants reflect on medical AI research during the subsequent years and characterize the maturity and influence that has been achieved to date. Participants focus on their personal areas of expertise, ranging from clinical decision-making, reasoning under uncertainty, and knowledge representation to systems integration, translational bioinformatics, and cognitive issues in both the modeling of expertise and the creation of acceptable systems.

Peek, N., et al. (2015). "Thirty years of artificial intelligence in medicine (AIME) conferences: A review of research themes." Artif Intell Med 65(1): 61-73.
	BACKGROUND: Over the past 30 years, the international conference on Artificial Intelligence in MEdicine (AIME) has been organized at different venues across Europe every 2 years, establishing a forum for scientific exchange and creating an active research community. The Artificial Intelligence in Medicine journal has published theme issues with extended versions of selected AIME papers since 1998. OBJECTIVES: To review the history of AIME conferences, investigate its impact on the wider research field, and identify challenges for its future. METHODS: We analyzed a total of 122 session titles to create a taxonomy of research themes and topics. We classified all 734 AIME conference papers published between 1985 and 2013 with this taxonomy. We also analyzed the citations to these conference papers and to 55 special issue papers. RESULTS: We identified 30 research topics across 12 themes. AIME was dominated by knowledge engineering research in its first decade, while machine learning and data mining prevailed thereafter. Together these two themes have contributed about 51% of all papers. There have been eight AIME papers that were cited at least 10 times per year since their publication. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a major shift from knowledge-based to data-driven methods while the interest for other research themes such as uncertainty management, image and signal processing, and natural language processing has been stable since the early 1990s. AIME papers relating to guidelines and protocols are among the most highly cited.

Sacchi, L., et al. (2015). "From decision to shared-decision: Introducing patients' preferences into clinical decision analysis." Artif Intell Med 65(1): 19-28.
	OBJECTIVE: Taking into account patients' preferences has become an essential requirement in health decision-making. Even in evidence-based settings where directions are summarized into clinical practice guidelines, there might exist situations where it is important for the care provider to involve the patient in the decision. In this paper we propose a unified framework to promote the shift from a traditional, physician-centered, clinical decision process to a more personalized, patient-oriented shared decision-making (SDM) environment. METHODS: We present the theoretical, technological and architectural aspects of a framework that encapsulates decision models and instruments to elicit patients' preferences into a single tool, thus enabling physicians to exploit evidence-based medicine and shared decision-making in the same encounter. RESULTS: We show the implementation of the framework in a specific case study related to the prevention and management of the risk of thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation. We describe the underlying decision model and how this can be personalized according to patients' preferences. The application of the framework is tested through a pilot clinical evaluation study carried out on 20 patients at the Rehabilitation Cardiology Unit at the IRCCS Fondazione Salvatore Maugeri hospital (Pavia, Italy). The results point out the importance of running personalized decision models, which can substantially differ from models quantified with population coefficients. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the tool is potentially able to overcome some of the main barriers perceived by physicians in the adoption of SDM. In parallel, the development of the framework increases the involvement of patients in the process of care focusing on the centrality of individual patients.

	MOTIVATION: Single-centre studies in medical domain are often characterised by limited samples due to the complexity and high costs of patient data collection. Machine learning methods for regression modelling of small datasets (less than 10 observations per predictor variable) remain scarce. Our work bridges this gap by developing a novel framework for application of artificial neural networks (NNs) for regression tasks involving small medical datasets. METHODS: In order to address the sporadic fluctuations and validation issues that appear in regression NNs trained on small datasets, the method of multiple runs and surrogate data analysis were proposed in this work. The approach was compared to the state-of-the-art ensemble NNs; the effect of dataset size on NN performance was also investigated. RESULTS: The proposed framework was applied for the prediction of compressive strength (CS) of femoral trabecular bone in patients suffering from severe osteoarthritis. The NN model was able to estimate the CS of osteoarthritic trabecular bone from its structural and biological properties with a standard error of 0.85MPa. When evaluated on independent test samples, the NN achieved accuracy of 98.3%, outperforming an ensemble NN model by 11%. We reproduce this result on CS data of another porous solid (concrete) and demonstrate that the proposed framework allows for an NN modelled with as few as 56 samples to generalise on 300 independent test samples with 86.5% accuracy, which is comparable to the performance of an NN developed with 18 times larger dataset (1030 samples). CONCLUSION: The significance of this work is two-fold: the practical application allows for non-destructive prediction of bone fracture risk, while the novel methodology extends beyond the task considered in this study and provides a general framework for application of regression NNs to medical problems characterised by limited dataset sizes.

Tucker, A., et al. (2017). "Reprint of "Updating Markov models to integrate cross-sectional and longitudinal studies"." Artif Intell Med 81: 33-40.
	Clinical trials are typically conducted over a population within a defined time period in order to illuminate certain characteristics of a health issue or disease process. Cross-sectional studies provide a snapshot of these disease processes over a large number of people but do not allow us to model the temporal nature of disease, which is essential for modelling detailed prognostic predictions. Longitudinal studies, on the other hand, are used to explore how these processes develop over time in a number of people but can be expensive and time-consuming, and many studies only cover a relatively small window within the disease process. This paper explores the application of intelligent data analysis techniques for building reliable models of disease progression from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The aim is to learn disease 'trajectories' from cross-sectional data by building realistic trajectories from healthy patients to those with advanced disease. We focus on exploring whether we can 'calibrate' models learnt from these trajectories with real longitudinal data using Baum-Welch re-estimation so that the dynamic parameters reflect the true underlying processes more closely. We use Kullback-Leibler distance and Wilcoxon rank metrics to assess how calibration improves the models to better reflect the underlying dynamics.

	OBJECTIVE: Recently, fuzzy soft sets-based decision making has attracted more and more interest. Although plenty of works have been done, they cannot provide the uncertainty or certainty of their results. To manage uncertainty is one of the most important and toughest tasks of decision making especially in medicine. In this study, we improve the performance of reducing uncertainty and raising the choice decision level in fuzzy soft set-based decision making. METHODS AND MATERIAL: We make use of two appropriate tools (ambiguity measure and Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence) to improve fuzzy soft set-based decision making. Our proposed approach consists of three procedures: primarily, the uncertainty degree of each parameter is obtained by using ambiguity measure; next, the suitable basic probability assignment with respect to each parameter (or evidence) is constructed based on the uncertainty degree of each parameter obtained in the first step; in the end, the classical Dempster's combination rule is applied to aggregate independent evidences into the collective evidence, by which the candidate alternatives are ranked and the best alternative will be obtained. RESULTS: We compare the results of our proposed method with the recent relative works. Through employing our presented approach, in Example 5, the belief measure of the uncertainty falls to 0.0051 from 0.0751; in Example 6, the belief measure of the uncertainty drops to 0.0086 from 0.0547; in Example 7, the belief measure of the uncertainty falls to 0.0847 from 0.1647; in application, the belief measure of the uncertainty drops 0.0001 from 0.0069. CONCLUSION: Three numerical examples and an application in medical diagnosis are provided to demonstrate adequately that, on the one hand, our proposed method is feasible and efficient; on the other hand, our proposed method can reduce uncertainty caused by people's subjective cognition and raise the choice decision level with the best performance.
